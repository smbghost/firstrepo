Fork:
Fork is an operation been perform over
 the projects as real big projects 
contain chunks of pieces of code 
consisting of 1000 lines. 
Here if we try to do changes and 
if something goes wrong then it becomes
 very tedious for a programmer or
 community to correct it. So using 
this Fork operation we are creating a
 copy of the repository in which changes 
are supposed to be made and reflected 
without affecting the original project

There is a connection that exists between
 the fork of a repository and the original repository
 itself. 

Clone:
When we create a new repository on
 GitHub or Any repository on Github,
 it exists as a remote location where 
our / any other repository is stored. 
Cloning a repository creates a local
 copy on our computer so that we can 
sync between both the local and remote
 locations of the repository.

we can not contribute to the repository 
unless we are made the collaborator of 
the repository. Cloning is an ideal case
 when one wants to get his own copy of a
 repository where he may not be 
contributing to the original project.

How to clone a repository?

Open any repository on Github
Click on the code button to get the repository’s HTTPS or SSH URL.
We are ready to perform the clone using the git clone command in the 
 command-line interface as depicted in below visual aid.

Clone vs fork

Fork	Clone
Forking is done on the GitHub Account	Cloning is done using Git
Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account	Cloning a repository creates a copy of the original repository on our local machine
Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request	Changes made to the cloned repository cannot be merged with the original repository unless you are the collaborator or the owner of the repository
Forking is a concept	Cloning is a process
Forking is just containing a separate copy of the repository and there is no command involved	Cloning is done through the command ‘git clone‘ and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine

The overall culture on GitHub is one of openness. Post what you want to post, fork what you want to fork, and find new opportunities for collaboration. It sounds downright utopian. But reality always creeps in somewhere, and the fact that 77% of GitHub projects carry no license is not necessarily a move toward sharing and the free flow of ideas. As GitHub’s new site explains, if a project doesn’t have a license it may actually have more legal protection under federal copyright laws than code that has been designated with specific terms of use.

You’re under no obligation to choose a license and it’s your right not to include one with your code or project . . . But generally speaking, the absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend.

As part of an investigation into licensing, Black Duck Software surveyed one million projects across a number of code sharing sites, and found that overall 40% of them are unlicensed. On average this shows better licensing implementation than on GitHub, but the bottom line is that if you want your code to be open for use you need to choose a license that frees it up in the right ways. And this could save a lot of people a lot of money.

ON GITHUB THE THREE MAIN TYPES OF SOFTWARE LICENSES ARE:
The MIT License, 
which is meant to be extremely straightforward and open.
 It permits users to do anything with a given project as 
long as they credit the developer and don’t hold him or her 
liable for the project’s use.

The Apache License, 
which is similar to the MIT License,
 but also explicitly grants patent rights to users.

The GPL License, 
which is older, more limiting, and less 
popular than the other two. It is a copyleft
 license that requires users to track their changes 
if they modify and then distribute a project. 
Different versions of this license also restrict the use of 
modified code in various classes of hardware.
